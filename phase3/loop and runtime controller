Create 3 simple controllers and place you samples in each of the controller
Now we have the thread group with Loop count as 1
So all transaction by default will run only once with 1 user
But lets say in the entire testing I want to run HomePage transaction 3 times and rest all transaction should run once>then we can use loop Controller
Loop controller> run a transaction multiple times

We can change simple controller to Loop controller and loop count for that transaction
Now add the runtime controller to thread group
Disbale the lopp controller 
Copy the homepage sampler in Runtime controller 
In runtime controller> give runtime = 10 sec > this sample is going to execute continuously for 10 seconds
